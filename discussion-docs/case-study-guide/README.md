## Related to SCI Certificates

SCI Certificates are a future program of the GSF where we will be able to certify the disclosure of a SCI score. It's still in discussion and has not been approved by the Steering Committee in full as of this moment. 

Although the case study is **not** directly a SCI Certificate. The work done to complete a SCI Case Study will be enough to warrent a SCI Certificate once that proram has been launched.

This is an [example of what a SCI Certificate may look like](GSF%20SCI%20Certificate%20-%20WebSite.png) once it's launched.
