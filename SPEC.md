# Software Carbon Intensity for AI Specification

## Introduction

> ![NOTE] 
> TODO

- Why does this specification exist?
- What is its intended purpose?
- How this aligns and differs with the overall SCI specifcations (aka we are diving into some aspects of defining R for the area of AI)

## Scope

The SCI for AI aims to measure these core AI Paradigms (Foundational Approaches):

* Machine Learning (ML)
  * Supervised Learning
  * Unsupervised Learning
  * Reinforcement Learning
  * Deep Learning
    * Supports Computer Vision
    * Supports NLP
    * Supports Generative AI
    * Supports Speech Recognition/Processing
  * Predictive Analytics
* Symbolic AI (Classical AI)
* Probabilistic & Bayesian AI
* Evolutionary Algorithms
* Fuzzy Logic
* Hybrid AI (combining multiple paradigms)

And including but not limited to, these application-specific AI solutions
* Predictive Analytics
* Prescriptive Analytics
* Computer Vision
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The standard will also be applicable to emerging AI technologies such as:

* Generative AI
  * Text Generation (e.g., GPT)
  * Image Generation (e.g., DALL·E)
  * Video Generation
  * Music Generation
  * Code Generation  
* Agentic AI (Autonomous Decision-Making)
