# Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) for Artificial intelligence (AI)

A specification addressing the challenges of measuring Artificial intelligence carbon emissions

Created and managed by the [Software Standards Working Group](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software-standards-wg) in the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation).

## Scope

The purpose of this proposed specification is to assist AI practitioners—developers, data scientists, engineers, and decision-makers—in understanding and reducing the carbon footprint of AI systems. By making informed choices about model design, computational efficiency, and deployment strategies, practitioners can minimize emissions while maintaining performance.

We will develop a methodology for calculating the carbon emissions rate (SCI score) of AI software systems, including both classical AI and generative AI applications. This specification aims to provide a reliable, consistent, and comparable measure that practitioners can use to set targets and track progress in reducing carbon emissions throughout the AI lifecycle—from development and training to deployment and inference.
